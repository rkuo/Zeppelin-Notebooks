      "text": "%md \nBased on [The Tao of Modeling Spaces][1]\n\n* Something can be taken as a model if it is an abstraction of things from the real world, but it is simultaneously a thing from the real world. Whether we take it as a model or as a real/world thing depends on the context, i.e. on the point of view. \n\n* Models can be defined using metamodeling concepts formally or implicitly. Since implicit metamodels cannot be precisely defined using formalisms, as in the case of art, in the rest of this discussion we analyze only formal models. Nevertheless, much of the conclusions can also be applied to implicit metamodels.\n\nM0:\nThe M0 layer is the real world which includes all possible things that we try to represent using the models residing at the M1 layer. That representation is more or less abstract and simplified, depending on how rich our models are. \n\nM1:\nModels are defined using concepts defined in metamodels, so each metamodel determines how expressive its models can be. \n\nM2:\nM2 is the layer where the metamodels are located. The metamodels are also defined using some concepts. \n\nM3:\nThe set of concepts used to define metamodels resides at the separate M3 layer at the top of this architecture and is called meta-metamodel. Meta-metamodel is nothing more than a metamodel that is used by convention to define other metamodels; it also defines itself. \n\n#### Modeling Space\n\nA modeling space is a modeling architecture defined by a particular meta-metamodel. Metamodels defined by the meta-metamodel and models defined by those metamodels represent the real world from one point of view, i.e. from the point of view of that modeling space. As the meta-metamodel defines the core concepts used in defining all other metamodeling concepts, it is defined by itself. If it was defined by some other concepts, it would not be a meta-metamodel; it would be an ordinary metamodel in some other modeling space.\n\n![a few examples of well-known modeling spaces][2]  \n\nThe most straightforward example from this picture is the MOF modeling space. It is defined by the MOF meta-metamodel, which in turn is defined by itself. It defines various metamodels, for instance Unified Modeling Language or Ontology Definition Metamodel, that are used to describe models that represent things from the real world. \n\nYou can loosely consider a Java programming code is a model, and Java grammar is metamodel. The same reality is described in the context of other modeling spaces, like RDF(S) or EBNF spaces. We can describe/model the relationship or event of wind, fire or weather with Java program, or XML or UML. An item in the real world can model described/modeled by different modeling spaces. If we model the same reality in another modeling space, we will describe it with different kinds of models, highlighting other characteristics when abstracting from reality. The models from the first modeling space (i.e. Java) will be a part of reality that we can model using the models from the second modeling space (i.e. UML).\n\nIn figure below, clarifies this duality by an example of the same thing being simultaneously a model (orange color) and a real-world thing. MOF MS sees EBNF MS as a set of things from the real world.\n\n![model is real world things][3]\n\nAlong the vertical axis, the world is modeled in the MOF modeling space. Along the horizontal axis is the EBNF space hierarchy, which is a real-world thing in the MOF space. An interesting observation here is that any modeling space, like the EBNF space or even the MOF space itself, is a part of the real world from the MOF-space point of view. In general, the way we model some business system or another \"real\" domain is pretty much the same as the way we model meta-metamodels, metamodels or models from another modeling space. Of course, these models involve a certain level of abstraction, so there is a possibility of losing some information.\n\nThe fact that M1-M3 layers (orange oval-green rectangular-blue rectangular) are fiction and above the M0 layer does not mean that meta-metamodels, metamodels and models are things outside of reality. Everything is in the real world; we just use a convention to put some things in layers, depending on the context.\n\n\n[1]:http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2006_11/article4/\n[2]:http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2006_11/article4/images/figure5.gif\n[3]:http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2006_11/article4/images/figure6.gif",

Nevertheless, much of the conclusions can also be applied to implicit metamodels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM0:\n\u003cbr  /\u003eThe M0 layer is the real world which includes all possible things that we try to represent using the models residing at the M1 layer. That representation is more or less abstract and simplified, depending on how rich our models are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM1:\n\u003cbr  /\u003eModels are defined using concepts defined in metamodels, so each metamodel determines how expressive its models can be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM2:\n\u003cbr  /\u003eM2 is the layer where the metamodels are located. The metamodels are also defined using some concepts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM3:\n\u003cbr  /\u003eThe set of concepts used to define metamodels resides at the separate M3 layer at the top of this architecture and is called meta-metamodel. Meta-metamodel is nothing more than a metamodel that is used by convention to define other metamodels; it also defines itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eModeling Space\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA modeling space is a modeling architecture defined by a particular meta-metamodel. Metamodels defined by the meta-metamodel and models defined by those metamodels represent the real world from one point of view, i.e. from the point of view of that modeling space. As the meta-metamodel defines the core concepts used in defining all other metamodeling concepts, it is defined by itself. If it was defined by some other concepts, it would not be a meta-metamodel; it would be an ordinary metamodel in some other modeling space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src\u003d\"http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2006_11/article4/images/figure5.gif\" alt\u003d\"a few examples of well-known modeling spaces\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most straightforward example from this picture is the MOF modeling space. It is defined by the MOF meta-metamodel, which in turn is defined by itself. It defines various metamodels, for instance Unified Modeling Language or Ontology Definition Metamodel, that are used to describe models that represent things from the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can loosely consider a Java programming code is a model, and Java grammar is metamodel. The same reality is described in the context of other modeling spaces, like RDF(S) or EBNF spaces. We can describe/model the relationship or event of wind, fire or weather with Java program, or XML or UML. An item in the real world can model described/modeled by different modeling spaces. If we model the same reality in another modeling space, we will describe it with different kinds of models, highlighting other characteristics when abstracting from reality. The models from the first modeling space (i.e. Java) will be a part of reality that we can model using the models from the second modeling space (i.e. UML).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn figure below, clarifies this duality by an example of the same thing being simultaneously a model (orange color) and a real-world thing. MOF MS sees EBNF MS as a set of things from the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src\u003d\"http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2006_11/article4/images/figure6.gif\" alt\u003d\"model is real world things\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong the vertical axis, the world is modeled in the MOF modeling space. Along the horizontal axis is the EBNF space hierarchy, which is a real-world thing in the MOF space. An interesting observation here is that any modeling space, like the EBNF space or even the MOF space itself, is a part of the real world from the MOF-space point of view. In general, the way we model some business system or another \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; domain is pretty much the same as the way we model meta-metamodels, metamodels or models from another modeling space. Of course, these models involve a certain level of abstraction, so there is a possibility of losing some information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that M1-M3 layers (orange oval-green rectangular-blue rectangular) are fiction and above the M0 layer does not mean that meta-metamodels, metamodels and models are things outside of reality. Everything is in the real world; we just use a convention to put some things in layers, depending on the context.\u003c/p\u003e\n"
